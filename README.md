# Object Detection, Pose Estimation, Object Tracking, and Transfer Learning using YOLO

This project explores the capabilities of the latest YOLO (You Only Look Once) model for object detection, pose estimation, object tracking, and transfer learning tasks. YOLO is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection system that offers high accuracy and fast performance.

## Tasks

1. Object Detection: Leveraging the YOLO model, this task focuses on detecting and localizing objects within images or video streams.

2. Pose Estimation: This task extends object detection to estimate the pose (orientation and position) of detected objects, enabling applications like augmented reality and robotics.

3. Object Tracking: Building upon object detection, this task tracks the movement and trajectory of detected objects across consecutive frames in a video sequence.

4. Transfer Learning: This task explores fine-tuning the YOLO model on a custom dataset, enabling the model to detect and classify objects specific to a particular domain or application.
